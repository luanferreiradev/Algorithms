# Algorithms 🧠💻

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in algorithms, where I'll document and store implementations of algorithms that I'm learning or practicing.

## Objective 🎯

The main goal of this repository is to solidify my knowledge in algorithms and data structures, as well as improve my programming skills. Here, I'll cover various types of algorithms, from the most basic to the more advanced ones.

## Repository Structure 📂

- **/sorting_algorithms**: Implementations of sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort.
- **/search_algorithms**: Implementations of search algorithms including linear search and binary search.
- **/graph_algorithms**: Implementations of graph algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).
- **/dynamic_programming**: Implementations of dynamic programming algorithms such as the knapsack problem and Fibonacci sequence calculation.
- **/data_structures**: Implementations of data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
